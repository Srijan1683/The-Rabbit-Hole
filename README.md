# 🐇 The Rabbit Hole


An AI agent that takes any topic and spirals into connected discoveries across multiple knowledge domains. Give it *"Dyson Sphere"* and it pulls the core concept from Wikipedia, finds related books on Open Library, surfaces research papers from arXiv, discovers podcast episodes, and finds YouTube talks — all while deciding which sources are relevant based on what the topic actually is.

This is not a search engine. It's a research companion that follows connections, maintains memory across a conversation, and gets smarter the deeper you go.

---

## What It Does

You type a topic. The agent:

1. Reasons about which knowledge domains are relevant
2. Searches across up to 5 external sources simultaneously
3. Follows connections it discovers (a Wikipedia article mentions Carl Sagan → it goes and finds his books)
4. Composes a structured response: Overview, Connected Concepts, Read, Listen, Watch
5. Remembers everything so you can say *"go deeper on that second point"* and it knows exactly what you mean

## The Five Sources

| Source | Domain | What It Provides |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Wikipedia API | Core knowledge | Article summaries, linked entities, structured facts |
| Open Library API | Books | Book search, author info, subjects, full metadata |
| arXiv API | Research papers | Paper search, abstracts, authors, categories |
| Podcast Index API | Audio content | Episode search across 4M+ podcasts |
| YouTube Data API | Video content | Video search, talks, documentaries, lectures |

The agent decides which ones matter. *"Quantum entanglement"* hits arXiv hard. *"History of jazz"* skips arXiv and goes heavy on YouTube and podcasts.

## Database Schema

Five tables. Raw SQL, no ORM.

```
sessions                  — conversation sessions with metadata
conversation_history      — all user and assistant messages with token counts
tool_call_log             — every external API call the agent made
api_usage                 — rate limit tracking and response time logging
cached_api_responses      — cached results to avoid redundant API calls
```

## API Endpoints

### Sessions
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/sessions` | Create a new session |
| `GET` | `/sessions` | List all sessions (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/sessions/{session_id}` | Get session details |
| `DELETE` | `/sessions/{session_id}` | Delete session and all history |

### Explore

## SSE Event Types

When streaming, the client receives real-time events as the agent works:

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `thinking` | Agent is reasoning about which tools to use |
| `tool_call` | Agent is calling an external API |
| `tool_result` | Tool returned results |
| `content` | Agent is generating response text |
| `sources` | Final list of all sources used |
| `done` | Response complete |
| `error` | Something went wrong |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Postgres + Session Management
- Set up asyncpg connection pool on app startup
- Implement session CRUD with raw SQL
- Store and retrieve conversation history with token counts
- Auto-update `last_active_at` and `message_count` on every interaction

### Phase 2 — External API Tool Functions
- Build async wrapper for each of the 5 APIs
- Each wrapper handles errors, logs to `api_usage`, checks cache before calling
- Cache every response with TTLs (Wikipedia: 24h, YouTube: 6h, arXiv: 7d)
- Return structured Pydantic models from every tool

### Phase 3 — Agent Setup with OpenAI Agents SDK
- Define agent with a system prompt that instructs it to reason before calling tools
- Register each API wrapper as a named tool with descriptive docstrings
- Wire agent to `/explore`: load history → build context → run agent → store results
- Test with diverse queries to verify intelligent tool selection

### Phase 4 — Token Counting + Context Window Management
- Build token budget calculator per model (e.g., gpt-4o = 128K context)
- Allocate tokens: system prompt → current query → reserve for response → fill with history
- Implement history truncation: recency-first, always keep first message, summarize overflow
- Cap per-tool output token size to prevent tool results from flooding context

### Phase 5 — Rate Limit Management
- Track rate limit headers after every external API call
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter on 429 responses
- Proactively slow down when quota drops below 10%
- Expose `/rate-limits` endpoint showing live status for all APIs

### Phase 6 — SSE Streaming
- Stream agent execution in real-time using `sse-starlette`
- Emit typed events: `thinking`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `content`, `sources`, `done`
- Handle client disconnection mid-stream — stop agent, don't waste API calls
- Always persist full response to Postgres regardless of streaming

---

## Key Concepts

### How Tool Calling Works

The agent does not execute tools itself. The loop is:

```
1. Model receives: system prompt + history + available tools
2. Model outputs: "I want to call Wikipedia with query X"
3. Your code: executes the Wikipedia API call
4. Model receives: the results
5. Model decides: call another tool OR generate final response
6. Repeat until response is generated
```

Tool descriptions are prompts. How you describe each tool directly determines when the agent uses it.

### Why Context Window Management Matters

gpt-4o has 128K tokens. That sounds like a lot until a long session has 20 conversation messages, 5 tool results, and a detailed system prompt. Without token budgeting, the agent silently loses earlier context, hallucinates about past conversation, or errors out entirely. Every production agent needs this.

### Why Sessions Matter

A session isn't just chat history. It's the full research journey — what was asked, what tools were called, what was found, what connections were made. When you say *"go deeper on that"*, the agent needs the entire journey to know what *"that"* refers to.

---

## Stretch Goals

- **Exploration graph** — Mermaid diagram showing which topics branched into which discoveries
- **"Surprise me" mode** — Agent picks a random connected concept and explores it unprompted
- **Depth control** — `go shallow` (overview + top 3 links) vs `go deep` (follow every thread)
- **Export session** — Download the full exploration as a formatted markdown research report
- **Multi-user sessions** — Multiple users exploring the same topic together
